# Known Issues
- Need to fix somethings regarding Wall Furni as they are a bit different
- Maybe wall items on trades, aren't with correct values right now
- Doesn't check wallitems on double click
- I didn't do a check to know if you can be banned by spamming the check average on MarketPlace so no feature was done to avoid if this happens (use at own risk)
